# OrmanStickyDicT

StickyDicT is a concept that is currently in the backlog. 

It is a tool that makes python dictionaries stateful or persistent. 
Utilitzing OrmanSpaces technology, StickyDicTs are databaseless <-- yeah I said it lol, 
if lambda is serverless then these are databaseless ;)

It should be considered for lighter task duty, or quick one off book keeping. Scripting, 
writing things on the fly. 

If your building something that will be using your dictionary a lot (more like a database), 

then StickyDicT probally isn't for you, theres not much reason to use StickyDicT, 

insead you should build your app using the OrmanSpacesPythonClient directly.
