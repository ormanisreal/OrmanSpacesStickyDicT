# OrmanStickyDicT

StickyDicT is a concept that is currently in the backlog. 

It is a tool that makes python dictionaries stateful or persistent. 
Utilitzing OrmanSpaces technology, StickyDicTs are databaseless <-- yeah I said it lol, 
if lambda is serverless then these are databaseless ;)

It should be considered for lighter task duty, or quick one off book keeping. Scripting, 
writing things on the fly. 

If your building something that will be using your dictionary a lot (more like a database), 

then StickyDicT probally isn't for you, theres not much reason to use StickyDicT as a backend

service. When automating exteremely repetetive tasks, you could spend 2 mins writing some logic 

 using the OrmanSpacesPythonClient directly. 
 
      2 mins / 2,000,000 runs <-- makes the time saved seem meaningless, considering the extra overhead
      
But if  you need something quick and scrappy 

    2 mins / 20,30,60 or even 100 hits makes StickyDickT a significant timesaver.
